Ruby's Linked List

In ruby, there's no need for a linked list, but itâ€™s the simplest of the dynamic data structures and it will give me a solid foundation, so I can understand more complex data structures like graphs and binary trees with more ease.

The linked_list comes with:
  #append,
  #preppend
  #size
  #head
  #tail
  #at
  #pop
  #contains?
  #find
  #to_s

You can run ruby_linked_list.rb file. There you will find just random information to test the different method's.
